<i>De-Bloater</i> is an application using the power of Magisk/Kernel SU/APatch to de-bloat unwanted applications systemless-ly. It easily remove system apps from "/system", "/vendor", and "/product" directories.

<i>De-Bloater</i> requires Root Access and a fully functional Magisk or Kernel SU/APatch environment, including modules, for proper working. As a result, De-Bloater won't work with other rooting solutions as well as in Magisk core-only mode.

<b>Features</b>

- Easily remove system applications from "/system", "/vendor", and "/product" directories (Reboot required).
- Restore de-bloated apps, either individually or as a whole (Reboot required).
- Includes pre-defined de-bloated scripts (Universal Android and Tomatot debloater).
- Elegantly designed user interface with an auto-dark/light theme.
- A lot more.

<b>How to Use</b>

Open the app, click the remove button on each app you want to remove. The selected apps will be removed systemless-ly after a reboot. To restore an app, either Reset Module (on the top menu) or selectively restore from the second page. Please note that a restart is necessary to get any of the changes in effect.

The app will systemless-ly replace the selected APKs by making a Magisk/Kernel SU/APatch module. As a result, you will see a new Module (name: De-bloater).

<b>Troubleshooting</b>

In case, if you accidentally remove some important apps and your phone bootloops, please delete "/data/adb/modules/De-bloater" via recovery.
