## Features
* Easily remove system apps from "/system", "/vendor", and "/product" directories.

## Requirement
De-Bloater requires Root Access and a fully functional Magisk or Kernel SU or APatch environment, including modules, for proper working. As a result, De-Bloater won't work with other rooting solutions as well as in Magisk core-only mode.

## How to Use
Open the app, click the remove button on each app you want to remove. The selected apps will be removed systemless-ly after a reboot. To restore an app, either Reset Module (on the top menu) or selectively restore from the second page. Please note that a restart is necessary to get any of the changes in effect.

## How it works
The app will systemless-ly replace the selected APKs by making a Magisk/Kernel SU/APatch module. As a result, you will see a new Module (name: De-bloater).

## Troubleshooting
In case, if you accidentally remove some important apps and your phone bootloops, please delete "/data/adb/modules/De-bloater" via recovery.
